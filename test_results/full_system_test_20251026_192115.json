The Standard is an integral part of all of our purchase orders and supply contracts and is share with our suppliers and expect them to follow its requirements, including compliance with forest regulations. To assess legal compliance with forest regulations and/or mandatory standards, our implementation partners start by carrying out a desk-based risk assessment of our sourcing regions and our suppliers based on supplier questionnaires, literature review and information from satellite monitoring tools. Supplier questionnaires include questions related to compliance with local regulation. Following this desk-based risk assessment process, suppliers are identified based on volumes and risk profiles for on- the-ground assessments\n\n\nThis information provides relevant guidance for: What are the quality standards?\n\nNote: This is a context-based response.
