Sample DFM Handbook - Design for Manufacturing Guidelines

Section 1: Dimensional Tolerances
All critical dimensions must maintain tolerances of ±0.001" unless otherwise specified.
For non-critical features, standard tolerances of ±0.005" are acceptable.
Hole diameters must be specified with tolerance class IT7 or better for precision fits.

Section 2: Surface Finish Requirements
Machined surfaces require a surface finish of Ra 1.6 μm (63 μin) or better.
Ground surfaces must achieve Ra 0.8 μm (32 μin).
Polished surfaces require Ra 0.4 μm (16 μin) for optical applications.

Section 3: Material Specifications
All aluminum parts must use 6061-T6 alloy or equivalent with minimum yield strength of 240 MPa.
Steel components shall be AISI 4140 with Rockwell hardness HRC 28-32.
Plastic parts must withstand operating temperatures from -40°C to 85°C.

Section 4: Manufacturing Constraints
Minimum wall thickness for injection molded parts: 1.5 mm for ABS, 2.0 mm for PC.
Draft angles must be minimum 1° per side for easy part ejection.
Inside corner radii should be at least 0.5 times the wall thickness.

Section 5: Assembly Requirements
Threaded fasteners must use locking mechanisms (thread locker or lock washers).
Press fits require interference of 0.001-0.003" for aluminum assemblies.
Welded joints must be inspected for penetration depth and minimum weld bead width.

Section 6: Quality Control
First article inspection required for all new production runs.
100% dimensional inspection on critical features defined in the control plan.
Statistical process control charts must be maintained for key characteristics.

Section 7: Safety and Compliance
All sharp edges must be deburred to maximum 0.5 mm radius.
Components in contact with food must be FDA approved materials.
Electrical insulation must withstand 1000V dielectric test.
